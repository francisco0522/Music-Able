# Music-able

This is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Holberton School.

## Project Description

<p>This project is for the DJ to take into account the songs his audience likes and the communication between the audience and the DJ is better, with Music-able it can be easily accomplished to help the DJ to know what music they want to listen to. It also offers the public the possibility of choosing the songs they want to listen to right now with a vote or paying for it.</p>
